/**
 * Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
 *
 * Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
 *
 * Determine if you are able to reach the last index.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what.
 * Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 104
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 105
